            <h3>My current experience</h3>
            <p>Currently, I have been having a much different experience in SP compared to secondary school due to the
                different
                teaching methods. I definitely am fond of my current experience as I finally get to study about
                something I
                am interested in compared to before. I also prefer to wear home clothes to school as I find it more
                comfortable
                compared to uniforms which is a huge plus!
