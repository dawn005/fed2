        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>i am Dawn Oh from DCITP 1A02 in Singapore Polytechnic. I was from Yishun Town Secondary School and
            joined this course to pursue my passion in the technology field. I chose common for me to make a more
            informed decision when ultimately choosing my diploma. I would like to also pursue further education after
            I graduate from Singapore Polytechnic at a local university.
        </p>

    <div class="values">
        <h3>Values</h3>
        <p>my main values are resilience and diligence as I always try not to give up until I succeed and I also
            put in hardwork and effort in everything I do. Although I am not a perfect person, I still always try
            to live by these values. One of the quotes I live by is "Treat others how you want to be treated"
            as I believe that respect for one another is extremely vital and is one of
            my core values.

        <h3>Interests</h3>
        <p>i enjoy listening to music and I listen to a variety of genres including pop, Kpop and Cpop. Music
            is a way for me to relax and unwind after a long day at school. I enjoy reading Webtoons on the app
            Webtoon as the art is very visually pleasing and the nice storylines are a huge plus! I also really like
            animals and have 2 dogs
            and this has also made me curious about the different animals in the world.
        </p>

    <div class="personality">
        <h3>Personality</h3>
        <p>i am someone who enjoys talking to my friends and I also like to make new friends. I usually
            also watch videos on Youtube and scroll through social media when I am bored or just commuting form
            my house to school and vice versa. My personality type is ISTP-T which stands for introverted, observant,
            thinking, prospecting and turbulent. Although I like spending time with my friends, I also need some
            time for myself alone to just chill and relax.
